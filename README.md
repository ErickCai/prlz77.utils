# prlz77.utils
Various utilities I accumulate over time for logging, running experiment queues, parsing, reporting, and much more!

## cross_val
Tools to perform cross-validation and hyperparameter search.
* [random_search.py](https://github.com/prlz77/prlz77.utils/blob/master/cross_val/random_search.py): Allows to specify a set of values for the hyperparameters and generate the points for a random search.

## loggers
Tools to log training processes.

* [json_logger.py](https://github.com/prlz77/prlz77.utils/blob/master/loggers/json_logger.py): Keep track of the model state into a json file.

## monitors
Tools to proactively monitor training processes (kill them in plateaus, etc).

* [harakiri.py](https://github.com/prlz77/prlz77.utils/blob/master/monitors/harakiri.py): Add conditions to make the process kill itself when it fails to fulfill them.

## parsers
Helpers to parse structured files.

* [pad_state_dict.py](https://github.com/prlz77/prlz77.utils/blob/master/parsers/pad_state_dict.py): adds padding to align multiple logged sequences.
* [parse_csv.py](https://github.com/prlz77/prlz77.utils/blob/master/parsers/parse_csv.py): commandline helper to search information in big csv files.

## queues
Manage batches of experiments, for instance keeping the GPU at 100% usage.

* [gpu_handler.py](https://github.com/prlz77/prlz77.utils/blob/master/queues/gpu_handler.py): given a number of gpus and processes per gpu, it keeps track of gpu usage to launch new processes when resources are available.

## reports
Gather all the information generated by your experiments into single nice reports.

* [json_report.py](https://github.com/prlz77/prlz77.utils/blob/master/reports/json_report.py): aggregates a list of .json logs, extracting the best epoch from each one and saving the results into a .csv file easy to import by spreadsheet software.

## plots
Tools to easily plot batches of results.

* [plot_json.py](https://github.com/prlz77/prlz77.utils/blob/master/plot_json.py): Customize and plot a list of json logs.
